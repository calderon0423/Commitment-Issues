# Housing Prices: A Tale of Two Cities

## Summary
In this report we explored the relationship between rental prices and household incomes. We also looked at the relationship between median rental price and homelessness. We gathered data on median rental prices, median household income, and homeless populations, by state.  
Zillow provided the median rental prices datasets for our analysis and is available on Kaggle. We used household income data from the US census.gov. Information on the homeless populations of each state was provided by the US Interagency Council on Homelessness.
